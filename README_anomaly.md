## How to Reproduce the Results and Graphics

### Optc data preprocessing         

Optc data format : .pikle
dyglib required format : .csv with [source node, destination node, timestamp (double), label, features 1, features 2,...]  

For the JSON files containing label annotations: https://github.com/AT03380/optc-labels/tree/main/labels

→ Execute the `optc_data_preprocessor.py` file to obtain the CSV files for machines 051 and 201 in the `DG_data` folder
```bash
python optc_data_preprocessor.py --host 051 --input_path graph_data --output_path DG_data/optc_051/optc_051.csv --label_path /raw_data/malicious.json
```
→ Perform preprocessing of the created CSV files by running in 'preprocess_data' folder:
```bash
python preprocess_data.py --dataset_name optc_051 --node_feat_dim 25
```
### Train 

→ Train according to the chosen model:

**Machine 051:**
```bash
python train_link_prediction.py --dataset_name optc_051 --model_name GraphMixer --optimizer Adam --learning_rate 0.0001 --batch_size 48 --num_epochs 1 --gpu 0 --val_ratio 0.065 --test_ratio 0.35 --num_runs 1
```

**Machine 201:**
```bash
python train_link_prediction.py --dataset_name optc_201 --model_name GraphMixer --optimizer Adam --learning_rate 0.0001 --batch_size 48 --num_epochs 1 --gpu 0 --val_ratio 0.098 --test_ratio 0.484 --num_runs 1
```

### Evaluation

→ Evaluate the models by executing the same commands, just replace `train_link_prediction` with `evaluate_link_prediction`.

To obtain results with different temperatures, you can add `--temperature 1` (1 baseline value, tests were conducted with 0.5, 1, 3).

## Tested Models:
- TGAT
- GraphMixer
- DyGFormer

**Notes:**
- EdgeBank has no interest here as it learns nothing.
- Memory-based models are too expensive and could not be run (TGN, DyRep, JODIE).
- CAWN and TCL were not tested.

The other models, apart from those tested, were removed from the code (they can be added back from the base library if needed), and the same applies to the NSS methods other than rnd, which were not working.

env.yml can be used to run all the scripts 

To split the datasets and determine the test and validation ratios, you need to run the first preprocessing code. It will produce a histogram to check if the distribution is suitable, and the output in the terminal will provide the ratios of values for test and train.
(The datasets are split temporally.)
